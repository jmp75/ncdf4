Title: Interface to Unidata netCDF (version 4 or earlier) format data
    files
Author: David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Maintainer: Jean-Michel Perraud <jean-michel.perraud@csiro.au>
Description: This package provides a high-level R interface to data files
    written using Unidata's netCDF library (version 4 or earlier), which are
    binary data files that are portable across platforms and include metadata
    information in addition to the data sets. This is a version of the package
    that uses the Visual C++ 2013 compiler for its C code. You should contact
    the maintainer if you are using this present version, not the author David
    Pierce. Using this package, netCDF files (either version 4 or "classic"
    version 3) can be opened and data sets read in easily. It is also easy to
    create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files, in either version 3 or
    4 format, and manipulate existing netCDF files. This package replaces the
    former ncdf package, which only worked with netcdf version 3 files.  For
    various reasons the names of the functions have had to be changed from the
    names in the ncdf package.  The old ncdf package is still available at the
    URL given below, if you need to have backward compatibility. It should be
    possible to have both the ncdf and ncdf4 packages installed simultaneously
    without a problem. However, the ncdf package does not provide an interface
    for netcdf version 4 files.
